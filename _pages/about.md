Welcome to my website! 

I am a first-year PhD student in theoretical physics at the University of Birmingham. This site includes PDFs of my publications, information about my research interests, details of my teaching activities, my CV, and other materials I wish to share with the world.

My research explores the fascinating links between quantum mechanics and classical electrodynamics, especially the topological phenomena that connect them, such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the hypothetical magnetic monopoles, or geometric phases.





<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
