  title={Dyons with phase $\delta=n\theta$},
  author={Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={In a recent paper (Heras in Eur. Phys. J. Plus 138:329, 2023), we have demonstrated that 
  when a dyon encircles an infinitely long solenoid enclosing electric and magnetic fluxes, its wave
   function accumulates a quantum phase invariant under electromagnetic duality transformations. 
   In this paper, we show that this phase, in conjunction with the Witten effect, gives rise to a 
   topological phase proportional to the vacuum angle $\theta\,$ and thereby connected with CP violation. 
   We show that this phase becomes quantised in a vacuum state $\delta=n\theta\,$  and that the 
   most general vacuum state associated with this quantisation identifies with an Abelian form of the
   $\theta\,$ -vacua. We discuss two hypothetical interference effects in the vacuum where the angle 
   $\theta\,$  could manifest.},

  title={The quantum phase of a dyon},
  author={Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={When a dyon encircles an infinitely-long solenoid enclosing uniform electric and magnetic fields, 
  its wave function accumulates a duality-invariant quantum phase, which is topological because it depends on 
  a winding number and is nonlocal because the enclosed fields act on the dyon in regions where these fields
   vanish. Here, we derive this dyon phase and show how its duality symmetry unifies the Aharonov-Bohm phase 
   with its dual phase. We obtain the energy levels, the two-slit interference shift, and the scattering 
   amplitude associated with the duality-invariant quantum phase. Assuming that the dyon has spin 1/2, 
   we show that this spin does not affect the introduced phase. We argue that a spin 1/2 dyon has electric 
   and magnetic moments, the former being greater than the latter because of the Schwinger-Zwanziger 
   quantisation condition.},

  title={The Aharonov-Bohm effect in a closed flux line},
  author={Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect was convincingly demonstrated using a micro-sized toroidal magnet 
  but it is almost always explained using an infinitely-long solenoid or an infinitely-long flux line. 
  The main reason for this is that the formal treatment of the AB effect considering a toroidal configuration 
  turns out to be too cumbersome. But if the micro-sized toroidal magnet is modelled by a closed flux line
  of arbitrary shape and size then the formal treatment of the AB effect is exact, considerably simplified,
  and well-justified. Here we present such a treatment that covers in detail the electromagnetic, 
  topological, and quantum-mechanical aspects of this effect. We demonstrate that the AB phase in a 
  closed flux line is determined by a linking number and has the same form as the AB phase in an
  infinitely-long flux line which is determined by a winding number. We explicitly show that the two-slit
  interference shift associated with the AB effect in a closed flux line is the same as that associated 
  with an infinitely-long flux line. We emphasise the topological nature of the AB phase in a closed flux
  line by demonstrating that this phase is invariant under deformations of the charge path, deformations 
  of the closed flux line, simultaneous deformations of the charge path and the closed flux line, and 
  the interchange between the charge path and the closed flux line. We also discuss the local and 
  nonlocal interpretations of the AB effect in a closed flux line and introduce a non-singular gauge 
  in which the vector potential vanishes in all space except on the surface surrounded by the closed 
  flux line, implying that this vector potential is zero along the trajectory of the charged particle
  except on the crossing point where this trajectory intersects the surface bounded by the closed 
  flux line, a result that questions the alleged physical significance of the vector potential and 
  thereby the local interpretation of the AB effect.},

  title={Topology, nonlocality and duality in classical electrodynamics},
  author={José A. Heras and Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={We have recently (Heras et al. in Eur. Phys. J. Plus 136:847, 2021) argued that classical 
  electrodynamics can predict nonlocal effects by showing an example of a topological and nonlocal 
  electromagnetic angular momentum. In this paper, we discuss the dual of this angular momentum which 
  is also topological and nonlocal. We then unify both angular momenta by means of the electromagnetic
  angular momentum arising in the configuration formed by a dyon encircling an infinitely long dual 
  solenoid enclosing uniform electric and magnetic fluxes and show that this electromagnetic angular
  momentum is topological because it depends on a winding number, is nonlocal because the electric 
  and magnetic fields of this dual solenoid act on the dyon in regions for which these fields are 
  excluded and is invariant under electromagnetic duality transformations. We explicitly verify that 
  this duality-invariant electromagnetic angular momentum is insensitive to the radiative effects of
  the Liénard-Wiechert fields of the encircling dyon. We also show how duality symmetry of this 
  angular momentum suggests different physical interpretations for the corresponding angular momenta
  that it unifies.},

  title={Can classical electrodynamics predict nonlocal effects?},
  author={José A. Heras and Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={Classical electrodynamics is a local theory describing local interactions between charges 
  and electromagnetic fields and therefore one would not expect that this theory could predict nonlocal 
  effects. But this perception implicitly assumes that the electromagnetic configurations lie in simply 
  connected regions. In this paper, we consider an electromagnetic configuration lying in a non-simply 
  connected region, which consists of a charged particle encircling an infinitely long solenoid enclosing 
  a uniform magnetic flux, and show that the electromagnetic angular momentum of this configuration 
  describes a nonlocal interaction between the encircling charge outside the solenoid and the magnetic 
  flux confined inside the solenoid. We argue that the nonlocality of this interaction is of topological
  nature by showing that the electromagnetic angular momentum of the configuration is proportional to 
  a winding number. The magnitude of this electromagnetic angular momentum may be interpreted as the 
  classical counterpart of the Aharonov-Bohm phase.},

  title={Dirac quantisation condition: a comprehensive review},
  author={Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={In most introductory courses on electrodynamics, one is taught the electric charge is quantised but no theoretical explanation related to this law of nature is offered. Such an explanation is postponed to graduate courses on electrodynamics, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, where the famous Dirac quantisation condition is introduced, which states that a single magnetic monopole in the Universe would explain the electric charge quantisation. Even when this condition assumes the existence of a not-yet-detected magnetic monopole, it provides the most accepted explanation for the observed quantisation of the electric charge. However, the usual derivation of the Dirac quantisation condition involves the subtle concept of an ‘unobservable’ semi-infinite magnetised line, the so-called ‘Dirac string,’ which may be difficult to grasp in a first view of the subject. The purpose of this review is to survey the concepts underlying the Dirac quantisation condition, in a way that may be accessible to advanced undergraduate and graduate students. Some of the discussed concepts are gauge invariance, singular potentials, single-valuedness of the wave function, undetectability of the Dirac string and quantisation of the electromagnetic angular momentum. Five quantum-mechanical and three semi-classical derivations of the Dirac quantisation condition are reviewed. In addition, a simple derivation of this condition involving heuristic and formal arguments is presented.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
