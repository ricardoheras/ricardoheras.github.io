  title={Dyons with phase $\delta=n\theta$},
  author={Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={In a recent paper (Heras in Eur. Phys. J. Plus 138:329, 2023), we have demonstrated that 
  when a dyon encircles an infinitely long solenoid enclosing electric and magnetic fluxes, its wave
   function accumulates a quantum phase invariant under electromagnetic duality transformations. 
   In this paper, we show that this phase, in conjunction with the Witten effect, gives rise to a 
   topological phase proportional to the vacuum angle $\theta\,$ and thereby connected with CP violation. 
   We show that this phase becomes quantised in a vacuum state $\delta=n\theta\,$  and that the 
   most general vacuum state associated with this quantisation identifies with an Abelian form of the
   $\theta\,$ -vacua. We discuss two hypothetical interference effects in the vacuum where the angle 
   $\theta\,$ could manifest.},

  title={The quantum phase of a dyon},
  author={Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={When a dyon encircles an infinitely-long solenoid enclosing uniform electric and magnetic fields, 
  its wave function accumulates a duality-invariant quantum phase, which is topological because it depends on 
  a winding number and is nonlocal because the enclosed fields act on the dyon in regions where these fields
   vanish. Here, we derive this dyon phase and show how its duality symmetry unifies the Aharonov-Bohm phase 
   with its dual phase. We obtain the energy levels, the two-slit interference shift, and the scattering 
   amplitude associated with the duality-invariant quantum phase. Assuming that the dyon has spin 1/2, 
   we show that this spin does not affect the introduced phase. We argue that a spin 1/2 dyon has electric 
   and magnetic moments, the former being greater than the latter because of the Schwinger-Zwanziger 
   quantisation condition.},

  title={The Aharonov-Bohm effect in a closed flux line},
  author={Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect was convincingly demonstrated using a micro-sized toroidal magnet 
  but it is almost always explained using an infinitely-long solenoid or an infinitely-long flux line. 
  The main reason for this is that the formal treatment of the AB effect considering a toroidal configuration 
  turns out to be too cumbersome. But if the micro-sized toroidal magnet is modelled by a closed flux line
  of arbitrary shape and size then the formal treatment of the AB effect is exact, considerably simplified,
  and well-justified. Here we present such a treatment that covers in detail the electromagnetic, 
  topological, and quantum-mechanical aspects of this effect. We demonstrate that the AB phase in a 
  closed flux line is determined by a linking number and has the same form as the AB phase in an
  infinitely-long flux line which is determined by a winding number. We explicitly show that the two-slit
  interference shift associated with the AB effect in a closed flux line is the same as that associated 
  with an infinitely-long flux line. We emphasise the topological nature of the AB phase in a closed flux
  line by demonstrating that this phase is invariant under deformations of the charge path, deformations 
  of the closed flux line, simultaneous deformations of the charge path and the closed flux line, and 
  the interchange between the charge path and the closed flux line. We also discuss the local and 
  nonlocal interpretations of the AB effect in a closed flux line and introduce a non-singular gauge 
  in which the vector potential vanishes in all space except on the surface surrounded by the closed 
  flux line, implying that this vector potential is zero along the trajectory of the charged particle
  except on the crossing point where this trajectory intersects the surface bounded by the closed 
  flux line, a result that questions the alleged physical significance of the vector potential and 
  thereby the local interpretation of the AB effect.},

  author={José A. Heras, and Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={We have recently (Heras et al. in Eur. Phys. J. Plus 136:847, 2021) argued that classical 
  electrodynamics can predict nonlocal effects by showing an example of a topological and nonlocal 
  electromagnetic angular momentum. In this paper, we discuss the dual of this angular momentum which 
  is also topological and nonlocal. We then unify both angular momenta by means of the electromagnetic
  angular momentum arising in the configuration formed by a dyon encircling an infinitely long dual 
  solenoid enclosing uniform electric and magnetic fluxes and show that this electromagnetic angular
  momentum is topological because it depends on a winding number, is nonlocal because the electric 
  and magnetic fields of this dual solenoid act on the dyon in regions for which these fields are 
  excluded and is invariant under electromagnetic duality transformations. We explicitly verify that 
  this duality-invariant electromagnetic angular momentum is insensitive to the radiative effects of
  the Liénard-Wiechert fields of the encircling dyon. We also show how duality symmetry of this 
  angular momentum suggests different physical interpretations for the corresponding angular momenta
  that it unifies.},

  title={Can classical electrodynamics predict nonlocal effects?},
  author={José A. Heras, and Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={Classical electrodynamics is a local theory describing local interactions between charges 
  and electromagnetic fields and therefore one would not expect that this theory could predict nonlocal 
  effects. But this perception implicitly assumes that the electromagnetic configurations lie in simply 
  connected regions. In this paper, we consider an electromagnetic configuration lying in a non-simply 
  connected region, which consists of a charged particle encircling an infinitely long solenoid enclosing 
  a uniform magnetic flux, and show that the electromagnetic angular momentum of this configuration 
  describes a nonlocal interaction between the encircling charge outside the solenoid and the magnetic 
  flux confined inside the solenoid. We argue that the nonlocality of this interaction is of topological
  nature by showing that the electromagnetic angular momentum of the configuration is proportional to 
  a winding number. The magnitude of this electromagnetic angular momentum may be interpreted as the 
  classical counterpart of the Aharonov-Bohm phase.},

  implementing this pedagogically interesting idea, we develop in this paper the approach of introducing 
  the scalar and vector potentials before the electric and magnetic fields. We consider the charge
  conservation expressed through the continuity equation as a basic axiom and make a heuristic handle of 
  this equation to obtain the retarded scalar and vector potentials, whose wave equations yield the

  title={The classical counterpart of the Aharonov-Bohm phase},
  author={Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={The existence of the Aharonov-Bohm phase shows that the magnetic field may produce nonlocal effects 
  in quantum mechanics. It is generally believed that such a nonlocal behavior of the magnetic field is not 
  possible in classical physics and that this represents a clear difference between classical and quantum 
  mechanics. Contrary to these beliefs, we argue that the classical counterpart of the Aharonov-Bohm phase, 
  which is identified here with the electromagnetic angular momentum of the configuration formed by an 
  electric charge moving around an infinitely-long solenoid enclosing a uniform magnetic flux, shows that 
  the magnetic field may produce nonlocal effects in classical mechanics. We discuss this momentum in detail 
  by putting special emphasis on its topological and nonlocal features. The momentum is topological because 
  it depends on the number of windings the electric charge carries out around the solenoid and is nonlocal 
  because the magnetic flux has no local consequences at any point on the charge trajectory. The topological
  feature allows us to introduce the concept of accumulated electromagnetic angular momentum and the nonlocal
  feature allows us to speak of a dynamical nonlocality attributable to the equations of classical 
  electrodynamics.},

  title={Dirac quantisation condition: a comprehensive review},
  author={Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={In most introductory courses on electrodynamics, one is taught the electric charge is quantised
   but no theoretical explanation related to this law of nature is offered. Such an explanation is postponed 
   to graduate courses on electrodynamics, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, where the famous Dirac 
   quantisation condition is introduced, which states that a single magnetic monopole in the Universe would 
   explain the electric charge quantisation. Even when this condition assumes the existence of a 
   not-yet-detected magnetic monopole, it provides the most accepted explanation for the observed 
   quantisation of the electric charge. However, the usual derivation of the Dirac quantisation condition 
   involves the subtle concept of an 'unobservable' semi-infinite magnetised line, the so-called 
   'Dirac string,' which may be difficult to grasp in a first view of the subject. The purpose of 
   this review is to survey the concepts underlying the Dirac quantisation condition, in a way that
   may be accessible to advanced undergraduate and graduate students. Some of the discussed concepts
   are gauge invariance, singular potentials, single-valuedness of the wave function, undetectability 
   of the Dirac string and quantisation of the electromagnetic angular momentum. Five quantum-mechanical
   and three semi-classical derivations of the Dirac quantisation condition are reviewed. In addition, 
   a simple derivation of this condition involving heuristic and formal arguments is presented.},

  title={Dirac Quantization Condition Holds with Nonzero Photon Mass},
  author={Alfred S. Goldhaber, and Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={Dirac in 1931 gave a beautiful argument for the quantization of electric charge, which required 
  only the existence in the universe of one magnetic monopole, because gauge invariance of the interaction
  between the pole and any charge could hold only if the product of the charge and the pole strength were 
  quantized in half-integer multiples of the reduced Planck constant. However, if the photon had a nonzero 
  mass, implying exponential decrease of the flux out of an electric charge, then Dirac's argument might 
  seem to fail. We demonstrate that the result still should hold. The key point is that magnetic charge, 
  unlike electric charge, cannot be screened, so that on any surface enclosing the pole Dirac's string, 
  or equally the Wu-Yang gauge shift, must be present, and to make either of these invisible to charged
  particles the quantization condition is required.},

  abstract={Using energy conservation we show that if a sudden external force of unknown nature causes a 
  newborn pulsar of mass M=1.4M⊙ and radius R=10 km to have the acceleration a0 then we can derive the 
  relation a0≃k-1vB-2/30, where v is the velocity of the pulsar, B0 its initial magnetic field and 
  k≈10-17G-2/3s. This relation predicts that a newborn pulsar with v=450 km experienced the acceleration
  a0≃1013g when B0≃1013G. An external force producing such an acceleration seems not to be physically 
  feasible. This pulsar could have experienced the more realistic acceleration a0≃109g if B0≃1018G. 
  But this huge magnetic field seems to be unrealistic.},

  title={Dyons with phase $\delta=n\theta$},
  author={Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={In a recent paper (Heras in Eur. Phys. J. Plus 138:329, 2023), we have demonstrated that 
  when a dyon encircles an infinitely long solenoid enclosing electric and magnetic fluxes, its wave
   function accumulates a quantum phase invariant under electromagnetic duality transformations. 
   In this paper, we show that this phase, in conjunction with the Witten effect, gives rise to a 
   topological phase proportional to the vacuum angle $\theta\,$ and thereby connected with CP violation. 
   We show that this phase becomes quantised in a vacuum state $\delta=n\theta\,$ and that the 
   most general vacuum state associated with this quantisation identifies with an Abelian form of the
   $\theta\,$ -vacua. We discuss two hypothetical interference effects in the vacuum where the angle 
   $\theta\,$ could manifest.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
