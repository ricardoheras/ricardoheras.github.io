@article{heras2022b,

  title={The Aharonov-Bohm effect in a closed flux line},
  author={Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect was convincingly demonstrated using a micro-sized toroidal magnet but it is almost always explained using an infinitely-long solenoid or an infinitely-long flux line. The main reason for this is that the formal treatment of the AB effect considering a toroidal configuration turns out to be too cumbersome. But if the micro-sized toroidal magnet is modelled by a closed flux line of arbitrary shape and size then the formal treatment of the AB effect is exact, considerably simplified, and well-justified. Here we present such a treatment that covers in detail the electromagnetic, topological, and quantum-mechanical aspects of this effect. We demonstrate that the AB phase in a closed flux line is determined by a linking number and has the same form as the AB phase in an infinitely-long flux line which is determined by a winding number. We explicitly show that the two-slit interference shift associated with the AB effect in a closed flux line is the same as that associated with an infinitely-long flux line. We emphasise the topological nature of the AB phase in a closed flux line by demonstrating that this phase is invariant under deformations of the charge path, deformations of the closed flux line, simultaneous deformations of the charge path and the closed flux line, and the interchange between the charge path and the closed flux line. We also discuss the local and nonlocal interpretations of the AB effect in a closed flux line and introduce a non-singular gauge in which the vector potential vanishes in all space except on the surface surrounded by the closed flux line, implying that this vector potential is zero along the trajectory of the charged particle except on the crossing point where this trajectory intersects the surface bounded by the closed flux line, a result that questions the alleged physical significance of the vector potential and thereby the local interpretation of the AB effect.},

  title={Dirac quantisation condition: a comprehensive review},
  author={Ricardo Heras},
  abstract={In most introductory courses on electrodynamics, one is taught the electric charge is quantised but no theoretical explanation related to this law of nature is offered. Such an explanation is postponed to graduate courses on electrodynamics, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, where the famous Dirac quantisation condition is introduced, which states that a single magnetic monopole in the Universe would explain the electric charge quantisation. Even when this condition assumes the existence of a not-yet-detected magnetic monopole, it provides the most accepted explanation for the observed quantisation of the electric charge. However, the usual derivation of the Dirac quantisation condition involves the subtle concept of an ‘unobservable’ semi-infinite magnetised line, the so-called ‘Dirac string,’ which may be difficult to grasp in a first view of the subject. The purpose of this review is to survey the concepts underlying the Dirac quantisation condition, in a way that may be accessible to advanced undergraduate and graduate students. Some of the discussed concepts are gauge invariance, singular potentials, single-valuedness of the wave function, undetectability of the Dirac string and quantisation of the electromagnetic angular momentum. Five quantum-mechanical and three semi-classical derivations of the Dirac quantisation condition are reviewed. In addition, a simple derivation of this condition involving heuristic and formal arguments is presented.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
